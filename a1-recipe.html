<h4>Directions:</h4>
</div>
<p>
The night before you plan to cook this, cut and clean your chicken and place it in a ziploc bag.
Pour the MOJO marinade into the bag until the chicken is completely covered. Put it in the refrigerator  for about 24 hours.
Remember to shake the bag to redistribute all of the spices. 
Add the 2 tablespoons of butter to a medium sized frying pan set to medium heat. 
Follow the directions on the back of the RICE A RONI box.
Once your rice is covered, set a timer for 20 minutes and reduce the heat to low.
Add the remaining tablespoon of butter to a pan and season your green pepper and onion strips with salt, <i>freshly</i> ground black pepper, garlic powder, and Mexican Chile powder.
Set the heat to medium and stir when necessary.
While your green pepper and onion are becoming best friends in the pan of love, begin cooking your chicken on the grill.
Begin cleaning your lettuce while everything is cooking. <!--That's not a euphemism-->
Cook your green pepper and onion as desired and wrap them in aluminum foil with your chicken once the chicken has been cooked thoroughly.
Place your tortillas, or if you have a tortilla warmer, place them in that with a damp paper towel in your handy dandy microwave and heat for 35-40 seconds on High.
